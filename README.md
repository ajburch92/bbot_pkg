The goal of this project is construct a two-link system that is able to accurately throw a small table tennis ball into a hoop that is located 4 feet from the fully extended arm. In order to best accomplish this task it was determined that the team of 8 should be divided into 3 sub-task teams consisting of CAD and manufacturing, modeling and controls, and programming and system implementation. Each team’s members can be seen in the title page. This report consists of the subteam design approaches, as well as a detailed description of the ROS bbot_pkg implemented in this system.
This robot utilized two DC brushed motors at the revolute joints, and an electromagnet at the end effector. The control system approach was to plan a consistent throwing path, with an optimal release position and end effector velocity as to make the ball through the hoop. The bbot_pkg system operated with a master node running Ubuntu on an laptop, and two Beaglebone Black nodes, one each for reading and driving a their respective joint. The results of this team's demonstration resulted in mechanical failure, and future work and predictive troubleshooting is discussed throughout this report to note the shortcomings and improvements.
